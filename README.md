# Stock Portfolio Tracker 
A Python-based application designed to help users manage their stock investments by calculating total portfolio value, gain/loss per stock, and visualizing asset allocation. The tracker uses hardcoded stock prices for simplicity, with modular functionality that can be extended to fetch real-time data or send automated investment reports.
